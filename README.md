# raindrops
Sample PyGame project

Draws rain in a screensaver-like manner. Can run fullscreen. Note that this script requires PyGame 
installed on your system. My version was 1.9. Most likely will work with older versions.

To run the program:

**chmod +x rain.py**
**./rain.py**

Use **./rain.py --help** to customize window size or run fullscreen.
